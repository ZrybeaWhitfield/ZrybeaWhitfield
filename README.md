### Hello! My name is Zrybea and I am a Philadelphia, PA based, Software Engineer. I am proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJs, and MongoDB. My goal is to write clean, dry, accessible code so that all users can have a great experience.

## Prior to coding, I have worked as a behavioral health professional, and served as a medic in the United States Army Reserve. I love to talk about my journey so ask away!

When I’m not coding, you can find me playing my favorite video games, working out, or cozying up with a good book.
